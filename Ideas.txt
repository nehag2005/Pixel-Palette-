- Paint bucket algorithm
- Work on the UI
- Add free hand drawing tools
- Turn off other tools when one is in use
- Give tool name when hovered over elements
- i want both hover and drawing modes to disable when paint bucket is enabled. there is a small bug when in drawing mode it click firsts, then paint bucket stops the clicking but then unclicking it resorts back to hover in drawing mode which shouldnt happen
